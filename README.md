# Big O Notation

-- Objectives

- describe Big notation
- define time complexity and space complexity
- define what a logarithm is

-- How do we know that is best for specific problem?
-- big-o is the way of generalizing code and talking about it and comparing code and its performance to other

-- what does better mean?

- faster
- less-memory-intensive

-- How we can identify which one is a better code without measuring timing?
